### Project on Chat application using Socket Programming in C
This is a Client/Server Chat Application using TCP Sockets.

## How it Works

Here is an example of how a very simple client-server chat application works. These are the stages involved:

	Step 1:  In any Client/Server Application, we need to run the server before the client, because the server keeps waiting for the client to be connected.
	Step 2: Server keeps listening for the client on an assigned IP & Port
	Step 3: For establishing connection client must know the IP & Port of the server.
	Step 4: When we start Client Application, It creates a connection to the server.

	Step 5: After the Successful connection Client & Server Applications can send & receive messages.
